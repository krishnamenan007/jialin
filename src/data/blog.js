The key knowledge is necessary for the current successful person and the organization as a whole in the global world. Here are three strategic themes, which are likely to be at the forefront of the next phase of the fintech revolution. </br><strong>Artificial </strong>Intelligence and Machine Learning: Artificial intelligence, in general, and machine learning, in particular, are improving several aspects of financial operations.

By so doing, it assists in slashing fraudulence incidences and helps cut down on numerous operational expenses with the aid of Blockchain technology’s tamper-proof record system. Further, through the use of smart contracts on block chain platforms, there can be self-executing contracts which do away with the intermediaries and simplify the process. \n Open Banking: Open banking is the concept of putting more control into the hands of the customer while encouraging third-party developers to create more applications regarding the affiliating financial institutions.

        content: `Modern life is full of financial transactions made on the internet, so the protection of your information is a must. Counterparts continue to develop and so does the threat to your finances, therefore it is crucial to be alert and put the right measures in place. Here are some specific pieces of advice that you can use to make sure your financial data is guarded. Employ Multi-Factor Authentication and Strong Passwords: The first and what I consider the most basic method of protecting your financial information is by use of strong and distinct passwords for each of the accounts. It was discovered that a good password is made of a combination of big and small letters; numbers and special characters. Do not use guessable answers; this can be names of cities, relationships, dates of birth, and common words. Still a unique password may not suffice in instances with no other means of shield, or when other security measures have failed. That is when multi-factor authentication otherwise referred to as two-factor authentication comes into play. MFA is a form of security that insists on the account user providing two or more means of identification before being granted access, such as a password and fingerprint scan, or a password and a code that has been sent to the user’s mobile device. This makes the task of the hacker, to get past this layer and get unauthorized access, much harder. Regularly Monitor Your Accounts: Another one of the major forms of protection for your cash is to monitor your bank accounts as well as credit cards. It also means making it a habit to check through the statement and the list of transactions for signs of fraud. All the financial institutions provide mail and SMS alerts in near real time for the transactions which acts as an instant way to report fraudulent activities. These are things that when you observe something amiss, it is advised that you contact the relevant bank or credit card firm to limit any loss. Beware of Phishing Scams: Phishing attacks are by far the most prevalent and the most perilous types of threats. Most of these scams are in the nature of emails, messages or even websites which may seem genuine but are indeed the traps the fraudsters set to catch their prey. Never trust any incoming message that demands your personal details or that invites you to go to a website. Before proceeding with action, check the source as to whether it is genuine or not. Thank you for your cooperation, we would like to remind you that, in any case, a legitimate company will not ask you for your password or other personal information via email. Thus, such rather simple and effective practices as using strongly protected passwords with multi-factor authentication, effectively monitoring your accounts, and avoiding clicking on tricky links in letters or emails, can greatly reduce your chances of ever becoming a victim in the cyber realm while keep your financial information away from hackers.`

        content: `In a world where doing business is increasing at an alarming rate, efficiency and accuracy are the keys in financial management. But one of the most revolutionary changes in this sphere is the automation of financial reporting. The organization can, therefore, reduce errors, make progress on the workflow and even analyze the results to make improved decisions and subsequently grow the organization.

Time efficiency: It also has many benefits, but potentially the greatest of all is the improved time efficiency of automated financial reporting. Reports are usually prepared using conventional approaches, for example, manual process of entry, verification, and validation of the data and hence are characterized by a lot of time wastage, delays, and batch errors. Whereas, there are automatic systems that sequentially collect, analyze, and synthesize data from different sources in order to perform the said processes. This makes it possible for the businesses to prepare and present accurate reports in a faster way than the conventional methods permit. The time is thus free for better analytical, planning and decision making activities that lie at the core of most businesses today. 


Precision and Reliability: Typing data manually is time-consuming as well as dangerous because it involves a high risk of errors and hence poor accounting. This in turn implies that even minor errors can create some serious problems such as misunderstanding and decision making as well as financial losses. Automated financial reporting systems minimize errors because they eliminate the differences between different people’s inputting techniques. They can also check such inputs for accuracy and inconsistencies, perform account reconciliations and ensure that the information generated is accurate and truthful. Business risk management, regulatory compliance and making strategic business decisions require an associated level of accuracy from any economic model. 

Real-Time Insights: A final advantage in using automated financial reporting is that it offers the facility of real-time data. Getting timely and accurate financial information is therefore very crucial especially where the market environment is Uncertain. Computerized methods offer the firms information relating to their performance within a short period, helping them to adapt to market forces, establish trends, and act adequately. It can provide certain organizations with some competitive advantage enabling one to exploit opportunities and at the same time minimize risks. 
 
In summary, automated financial reporting is not just a mere luxury, in fact, it is that critical tool that can prove influential and invaluable to decision-making that brings about efficiency and organizational growth. Through the use of these technologies, a business stands to derive high precision in its financial operations, timely data, and efficient resources to take the business to the next level in the long-run.
